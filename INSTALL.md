Installation
============

The code sources for the 12/19/2013 SeattleJS lightning talk,
"Backbone.js Testing" are contained in this repository,
which you will need for the workshop.

To run your tests from the command line, you will need a [Node.js][nodejs]
installation, and then from the root of this repository:

```
$ npm install
```

to install the necessary software.
